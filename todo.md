# TODO

- state management
    - save volunteer array to firebase? and then load again?
        - mostly achieved, getting an error when trying to store data
- add multiple drop-downs for each day/time/team cell.
- add the ability to manually add names
- export button to download as csv/pdf/something

## Questions for Client

- What should be the default behavior for a volunteer who has not yet submitted the form for the new month?
- For "serve x times per month", does this mean x days, or x times? As in, would scheduling someone for both 9am and 11am services count as 2 that month already, or just 1?
    - Currently assuming it would be 2.

## Future Development

- Draw team rows from Team options, which should be specified in the settings
- Make number of services and service times configurable
    - maybe create some way of specifying a template which is used, rather than lots of individual setting options
